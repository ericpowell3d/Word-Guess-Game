Description:

Hangman of guessing character names from The Witcher game series

Pseudo Code:

-set a names array
-get a random name from the array as the name to guess
-find the amount of letters in the name and fill in with underscores
-allow 6 guesses per name

-get each letter from this name and set these letters as correct guesses
-get a player guess and if it matches a letter, make only that letter visible and do not decrease the guess counter
-append a series of the letters that the player has already guessed

-if the player guesses all the letters, add a win and reset the name, amount of letters, amount of guesses, & letters guessed
-if the player guess amount hits 0, add a loss and reset the name, amount of letters, amount of guesses, & letters guessed
